# probability-calculator-Project5

This is the fifth and final project to the freeCodeCamp course for Scientific Computing with Python toward gaining a certification. 

It contains a class and a definition to calculate the probability of pulling a certain set of balls based on color from a pre-defined bag of balls. To do this, I use:
* attributes
* methods
* list comprehension

The file titled probability_calculator.py contains code and comments detailing functionality.
